**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**<br />
The best way of ensuring that my code is functional and secure would be to test it, prior to this course I would go thorugh my finished project and test that all of the functions of it are working and nothing is creating errors. In this course I learned how to make automated tests that work through the code and give a quick reference to what is working in the code how much of it is working effectively and securely.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**<br />
I interpret user needs by going through the requirements given and writting a list, from this list I then go step by step and add features into my programs. After I have these features included I then go through the requirements and write tests that ensure that the features funciton and do so correctly without producing any errors or the program accepting any inputs that it should not be able to.

**How do I approach designing software?**<br />
I approach designing software with care for the end user's requirements and make sure that these are all included and working correctly. Once the program's code is completed it is then important to test to ensure that the program is efficiently and affectively able to meet the given requirements while being secure, this should work to ensure that the software meets given requirements and does so in the best way I am capable of doing this.
